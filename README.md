- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt AKA @T3chedOut, I'm currently a software engineer for an aerospace company.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in lots of fun projects, either that improve my work quality for my job or that would make for a fun game.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web dev with python Flask and Node.js, some machine learning using PyTorch, always more Unity C#, and some Fortan for work.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Message me here on GitHub!
