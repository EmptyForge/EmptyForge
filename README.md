- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt AKA @T3chedOut, I'm currently a software engineer working at an aerospace company primarily developing physics simulation tools.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in lots of fun projects, either that can improve my product quality for my job or that would make for a fun game.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning webdev with python Flask and Node.js, some machine learning using PyTorch, always more C# for gamedev, and some Fortan and C++ for work.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Message me here on GitHub!
